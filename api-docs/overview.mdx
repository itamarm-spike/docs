Spike API provides a seamless way to integrate user data from various providers like Garmin and Fitbit into your application. Here's a quick guide to understanding the flow of using the Spike API:

1. **Authentication**

   - **User Authentication via HMAC**
     - **Generate HMAC Signature**: Use a shared secret key from the admin console to create an HMAC-SHA256 signature for each user. [Learn more about generating HMAC signatures](/api-docs/authentication).
     - **Exchange Signature for Access Token**: Send the signature to the Spike API endpoint to obtain an access token. This token is used to authenticate API requests. [Learn more about exchanging signatures for access tokens](/api-docs/authentication).

2. **Provider Integration**

   - **Obtain Redirect URL**: Some providers require user consent. Use the API to get a URL to redirect users for consent. [Learn more about obtaining redirect URLs](/api-docs/provider_integration).
   - **Redirect the User**: Direct users to the provided URL to authorize data access. After integration, users are redirected back to your application. [Learn more about redirecting users](/api-docs/provider_integration).

3. **Webhooks**

   - **Configure Webhook Endpoint**: Set up an endpoint to receive data updates from providers. Ensure your endpoint responds with HTTP 200 to acknowledge receipt. [Learn more about configuring webhook endpoints](/api-docs/webhooks).
   - **Handle Webhook Events**: Webhook events include data updates, integration status changes, and more. Each event is signed with an HMAC-SHA256 signature for verification. [Learn more about handling webhook events](/api-docs/webhooks).

4. **Data Retrieval Using Queries**

   Spike API provides various query options to retrieve user data, each suited for different needs and use cases. For a comprehensive comparison of these query options and guidance on selecting the right one for your application, refer to the [Query Options Comparison documentation](/api-docs/query_options_comparison).
