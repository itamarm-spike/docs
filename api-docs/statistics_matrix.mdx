## Statistics

The following table lists all the statistics available, along with their descriptions, applicable methods, associated metrics, units of measurement, and output precision.

| **Label** | **Description** | **Methods** | **Metrics** | **Unit** | **Output Precision** |
|:----------|:----------------|:------------|:------------|:---------|:---------------------|
| sleep_score | Overall sleep score based on various sleep metrics, calculated using intersecting values. | sleep_score |  | count | 0 |
| steps | Total number of steps taken, aggregated using intersecting values. | intersect_sum | steps | count | 0 |
| distance_total | Total distance covered across all activities, calculated using the union of intersecting values. | intersect_union_sum | distance, distance_walking, distance_cycling, distance_running | meters | 4 |
| distance_walking | Total distance covered while walking, aggregated using intersecting values. | intersect_sum | distance_walking | meters | 4 |
| distance_cycling | Total distance covered while cycling, aggregated using intersecting values. | intersect_sum | distance_cycling | meters | 4 |
| distance_running | Total distance covered while running, aggregated using intersecting values. | intersect_sum | distance_running | meters | 4 |
| calories_burned_basal | Calories burned at rest (basal metabolic rate), aggregated using intersecting values. | intersect_sum | calories_burned_basal | kcal | 4 |
| calories_burned_active | Calories burned during active periods, aggregated using intersecting values. | intersect_sum | calories_burned_active | kcal | 4 |
| calories_burned_total | Total calories burned including basal and active periods, calculated using the union of intersecting values. | intersect_union_sum | calories_burned, calories_burned_basal, calories_burned_active | kcal | 4 |
| sleep_duration_total | Total sleep duration across all sleep stages, calculated using the union of intersecting values. | intersect_union_sum | sleep_duration_deep, sleep_duration_light, sleep_duration_rem, sleep_duration_awake | ms | 0 |
| heartrate | Average heart rate over a period, calculated using duration-weighted average. | duration_weighted_avg | heartrate | bpm | 0 |
| heartrate_max | Maximum recorded heart rate, providing insights into peak values. | max | heartrate | bpm | 0 |
| heartrate_min | Minimum recorded heart rate, providing insights into lowest values. | min | heartrate | bpm | 0 |
| heartrate_resting | Average resting heart rate, calculated using duration-weighted average. | duration_weighted_avg | heartrate_resting | bpm | 0 |


## Methods

The table below provides details on the various methods used in the statistics, including a brief description of each.

| **Label** | **Description** |
|:----------|:----------------|
| intersect_sum | Sum of intersecting values of specified metrics, aggregating overlapping data points to provide a total count or sum. |
| intersect_union_sum | Sum of the union of intersecting values, merging several metrics to provide a comprehensive aggregation across multiple metrics. |
| sleep_score | A score representing the quality of sleep, calculated using intersecting values. |
| duration_weighted_avg | Average of values weighted by their duration, ensuring longer durations have a greater impact on the average. |
| max | Maximum value of the specified metrics, providing insights into the peak values recorded. |
| min | Minimum value of the specified metrics, providing insights into the lowest values recorded. |
