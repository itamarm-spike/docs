title: "Query Statistics"
description: "Statistics Types and Calculation"
---

This document provides an overview of the different statistics types available in our API, how they are calculated, and how you can query them using our RESTful API.

### Calculation Methods

- **Sum of Intersecting Values**: This method sums the intersecting values of the specified metrics. It is used to aggregate data points that overlap in time, providing a total count or sum of those values.
- **Sum of Union of Intersecting Values**: This method sums the union of intersecting values, allowing for a comprehensive aggregation across multiple metrics. It merges several metrics such as `distance`, `distance_walking`, `distance_cycling`, and `distance_running` to provide a total distance covered. This method is useful for combining related metrics to derive a more holistic view.
- **Duration Weighted Average**: This method calculates the average of values weighted by their duration, ensuring that longer durations have a greater impact on the average.
- **Maximum/Minimum Value**: These methods return the maximum or minimum value of the specified metrics, providing insights into the peak or lowest values recorded.

### Statistics Types

Our API supports a variety of statistics types, each designed to provide insights into different aspects of data. Below is a list of available statistics types, their descriptions, and the calculation methods used:

- **sleep_score**: Provides a score representing the quality of sleep. Unit: `count`. Method: **Sum of Intersecting Values**.
- **steps**: Total number of steps taken. Unit: `count`. Method: **Sum of Intersecting Values**.
- **distance_total**: Total distance covered across activities like walking, cycling, and running. Unit: `meters`, precision: 4 decimal places. Method: **Sum of Union of Intersecting Values**.
- **distance_walking**: Distance covered while walking. Unit: `meters`, precision: 4 decimal places. Method: **Sum of Intersecting Values**.
- **distance_cycling**: Distance covered while cycling. Unit: `meters`, precision: 4 decimal places. Method: **Sum of Intersecting Values**.
- **distance_running**: Distance covered while running. Unit: `meters`, precision: 4 decimal places. Method: **Sum of Intersecting Values**.
- **calories_burned_basal**: Basal calories burned. Unit: `kcal`, precision: 4 decimal places. Method: **Sum of Intersecting Values**.
- **calories_burned_active**: Active calories burned. Unit: `kcal`, precision: 4 decimal places. Method: **Sum of Intersecting Values**.
- **calories_burned_total**: Total calories burned, including basal and active. Unit: `kcal`, precision: 4 decimal places. Method: **Sum of Union of Intersecting Values**.
- **sleep_duration_total**: Total sleep duration across different sleep stages. Unit: `ms`, precision: 0. Method: **Sum of Union of Intersecting Values**.
- **heartrate**: Average heart rate over a duration. Unit: `bpm`, precision: 0. Method: **Duration Weighted Average**.
- **heartrate_max**: Maximum heart rate recorded. Unit: `bpm`, precision: 0. Method: **Maximum Value**.
- **heartrate_min**: Minimum heart rate recorded. Unit: `bpm`, precision: 0. Method: **Minimum Value**.
- **heartrate_resting**: Average resting heart rate. Unit: `bpm`, precision: 0. Method: **Duration Weighted Average**.

### Querying Statistics

To query statistics, you can use our RESTful API. Below is an example of how to query for statistics:

#### Request Example

```json
{
  "from": "2024-01-01",
  "to": "2024-01-02",
  "types": ["steps"],
  "interval": "day"
}
```

- **from**: The start date for the statistics query.
- **to**: The end date for the statistics query.
- **types**: An array of statistic types you want to query.
- **interval**: The interval window for aggregating data (e.g., `day`, `hour`).

#### Response Example

```json
{
  "statistics": [
    {
      "timestamp_from": "2024-01-01",
      "timestamp_to": "2024-01-02",
      "values": {
        "steps": 1000
      },
      "record_ids": ["ff000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"]
    }
  ]
}
```

- **timestamp_from**: The start timestamp of the aggregated data.
- **timestamp_to**: The end timestamp of the aggregated data.
- **values**: The aggregated values for the specified statistic types.
- **record_ids**: Unique identifiers for the records included in the aggregation.
