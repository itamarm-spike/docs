description: "Statistics Types and Calculation"
---

This document provides an overview of the different statistics types available in our API, how they are calculated, and how you can query them using our RESTful API.


### Understanding Statistics

Statistics are calculated based on the data available for a specific time period. The data is aggregated according to the time interval specified in your request. This means that if you request data with a daily interval, the statistics will be aggregated and presented for each day within the specified time range. Similarly, if you choose an hourly interval, the data will be broken down and aggregated for each hour.

The aggregation process involves summing up or averaging the data points within each interval, depending on the type of statistic being queried. This allows you to see trends and patterns over time, making it easier to analyze the data and draw meaningful insights.

### Querying Statistics

To query statistics, you can use our RESTful API. Below is an example of how to query for statistics:

#### Request Example

```json
{
  "from": "2024-01-01",
  "to": "2024-01-02",
  "types": ["steps"],
  "interval": "day"
}
```

<ParamField body="from" type="string" required>
  The start date for the statistics query.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="to" type="string" required>
  The end date for the statistics query.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="types" type="array" required>
  An array of statistic types you want to query.
For a detailed overview of all available statistics, including their methods, metrics, units, and descriptions, please refer to the [Statistics Support Matrix](/statistics_matrix).
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="interval" type="string" required>
  The interval window for aggregating data (e.g., `day`, `hour`).
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="include_record_ids" type="boolean">
  Whether to include the record IDs in the response.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="include_providers" type="boolean">
  Whether to include the relevant provider slug in the response.
</ParamField>

<Note>
  Time is expected in ISO 8601 format or YYYY-MM-DD format.
</Note>

#### Response Example

```json
{
  "statistics": [
    {
      "timestamp_from": "2024-01-01",

      "values": {
        "steps": 1000
      },
      "record_ids": ["ff000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"]
