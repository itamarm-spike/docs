## User Authentication via HMAC – Spike API

Spike API authenticates end users using **HMAC signatures** generated with a **shared secret key**. You can obtain this key from the **administrative console**.

Spike API authenticates end users using HMAC signatures generated with a shared key. You can obtain this key from the administrative console.

## Step 1: Generate an HMAC Signature

Use the secret key from your console to generate an HMAC-SHA256 signature for each user.

@TODO add screenshow of where to copy the key from

@TODO include code examples here

## Step 2: Exchange Signature for Access Token

Send the generated signature to the following endpoint to authorize the user and obtain an access token:

### Required Parameters

- **application_id **The ID of the application for which you are requesting the access token.
- **application_user_id** The unique ID of the user in your system. This is the only identifier needed to reference the use
  - Maximum 1-128 alphanumeric characters
  - May include these special characters: - \_ .
- **signature** The HMAC signature generated to verify the user’s authenticity.

### Example Request

```bash
curl --location 'https://app-api.spikeapi.com/v3/auth/hmac' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'Accept: application/json' \
    --data '{
        "application_id": 9999,
        "application_user_id": "my_application_user_123",
        "signature": "string"
    }'
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiI5OTk5Iiwic3ViIjoiYXBwbGljYXRpb24tdXNlci1pZC0xMjMifQ.XnI1y4tkRjdiSeHwUqdmk9em-hTPojtMzbOU30nMd_Y"
}
```

The **application_user_id** must be consistent throughout the user's lifecycle. No pre-registration is required—users are valid after the first provider integration.

## Step 3: Store and Use the Access Token

On successful authentication, the API will return an **access token** in the response. Store this token securely and include it in the Authorization header for all subsequent API calls:

`Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
