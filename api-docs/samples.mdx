description: "Samples Query and Usage"
---

This document provides an overview of the samples query available in our API, how it is structured, and how you can query it using our API.

### Understanding Samples

Samples represent raw or minimally processed data points collected over time. They are typically used to capture detailed information about specific metrics, such as steps taken, heart rate, or other health-related metrics. Unlike aggregated statistics, samples provide a granular view of the data, allowing for detailed analysis and insights into patterns or trends over time.

### Querying Samples

To query samples, you can use our API. Below is an example of how to query for samples:

#### Request Example

```json
{
  "from": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "to": "2024-01-02T00:00:00Z",
  "metrics": ["steps"],
  "include_record_ids": true,
  "include_providers": false
}
```

<ParamField body="from" type="string" required>
  The start date for the samples query.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="to" type="string" required>
  The end date for the samples query.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="metrics" type="array" required>
  An array of metrics you want to query.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="include_record_ids" type="boolean">
