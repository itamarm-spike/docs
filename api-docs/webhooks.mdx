To receive data updates, configure a webhook endpoint via the admin console. After each data update from the provider, a webhook event will be sent to your endpoint.

Your endpoint **must respond with HTTP 200** to acknowledge successful receipt. If the request fails due to a network error or returns any status code other than 200, the system will retry the request **up to 5 times** with exponential backoff. After the final attempt, the event will be discarded.

## Webhook event Payload

- **application_user_id** The application user ID you've provided when getting the access token
- **timestamp** Time of the event
- **event_type**
  - **record_change** new or updated data recieved from the provider
  - **provider_integration_created** user has integrated with a provider
  - **provider_integration_deleted** user integration has been deleted
- **metrics** metrics involved with the event
- **activity_types** activity types if any involved with the event
- **provider_slug** provider triggering the event
- **earliest_record_start_at **earliest timestamp of records involved with the event
- **latest_record_end_at** latest timetamp of records involved with the event

```

## Signature

Each webhook event is signed using an HMAC-SHA256 signature for verification. The signature is included in the **X-Body-Signature** header.

The signature is computed by signing the raw request body **as-is** using a shared secret key. You can retrieve this key from the admin console.

To verify authenticity:

1. Compute the HMAC-SHA256 hash of the request body using the shared key.
2. Compare the result to the value in the X-Body-Signature header.
