# Getting Started with Spike API

Spike API provides a powerful platform for integrating health and fitness data from various providers like Garmin, Fitbit, and more. This guide will help you understand the key differences between using our API directly versus using our SDK.

## Spike API Overview

The Spike API enables seamless integration with health and fitness data providers through:

- Secure authentication using HMAC signatures
- Comprehensive endpoints for data access
- Provider integration management
- User authentication and data management

## API vs SDK: Choosing Your Integration Path

The API offers robust control and server-side processing, while the SDK simplifies integration with automatic handling of common tasks.



### Using the API Directly
  ```mermaid
  sequenceDiagram
    participant ClientApp as Client Application
    participant ClientServer as Client Server
    participant SpikeSDK as Spike SDK
    participant SpikeAPI as Spike API
    participant Provider as Data Provider
    ClientApp->>SpikeSDK: Request Provider Integration
    activate SpikeSDK
    SpikeSDK->>SpikeAPI: Initiate Provider Integration
    deactivate SpikeSDK
    SpikeAPI->>Provider: Integrate
    Provider->>SpikeAPI: Continously Sync Data
    SpikeAPI->>ClientServer: Webhook Event
    ClientServer->>SpikeAPI: Query Data
    activate SpikeAPI
    SpikeAPI->>ClientServer: Return Data
    deactivate SpikeAPI
  ```
  <p>Ideal for scenarios where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data needs to be available for central processing on a server</li>
    <li>Developers require fine-grained control over data handling</li>
    <li>Custom server-side authentication flows are necessary</li>
  </ul>

### Using the SDK

  <h3>SDK Integration</h3>
  ```mermaid
  sequenceDiagram
    participant ClientApp as Client Application
    participant SpikeSDK as Spike SDK
    participant SpikeAPI as Spike API
    participant Provider as Data Provider
    ClientApp->>SpikeSDK: Request to Integrate with Provider
    activate SpikeSDK
    SpikeSDK->>SpikeAPI: Start Provider Integration Process
    deactivate SpikeSDK
    SpikeAPI->>Provider: Establish Integration
    Provider->>SpikeAPI: Continuously Synchronize Data
    ClientApp->>SpikeSDK: Request Data Retrieval
    activate SpikeSDK
    SpikeSDK->>SpikeAPI: Forward Data Query
    deactivate SpikeSDK
    SpikeAPI->>ClientApp: Deliver Retrieved Data
  ```
  <p>Best suited for applications where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data is primarily used within the context of an app</li>
    <li>Simplified integration with minimal setup is preferred</li>
    <li>
      Automatic handling of authentication and error management is beneficial
    </li>
  </ul>
