Start getting Spike data in 3 steps. All Spike SDK async method calls should be wrapped into try catch block.

## Step 1 - Create Spike connection

To set up the Spike SDK create `SpikeConnectionV3` instance with your Spike application id, auth token and user id unique to each of your users:

```swift
import SpikeSDK
static func createConnectionAPIv3(
    applicationId: Int,
    signature: String,
    endUserId: String
) async throws -> SpikeConnectionAPIv3
)
```

## Step 2 - Ask user for permissions

Provide permissions to access iOS HealthKit data. Spike SDK method will check required permissions and request them if needed. Permission dialog may not be shown according on iOS permissions rules.

```swift
try await spikeConnectionTemp.requestPermissions(forStatistics: [
        .stepsTotal,
        .distanceWalking,
    ]
)
```

## Step 3 - Get data

Info: The maximum permitted date range is 90 days

There are two types of data you can retrieve from Spike:

- **Records** consist of the raw data points collected from user devices or applications.
- **Statistics**, on the other hand, are calculated values derived from records.

#### Statistics

Get daily statistics for steps and total distance from Apple Health:

```swift
func getStatistics(
    ofTypes types: [StatisticsType.steps],
    from: Date.now.addingTimeInterval(-60 * 60 * 24),
    to: Date.now,
    interval: StatisticsInterval.hour,
    filter: StatisticsFilter(providers: [.apple])
) async throws -> [Statistic]
```

where:

```swift
public enum StatisticsType: String {
    case steps
    case distanceTotal = "distance_total"
    case distanceWalking = "distance_walking"
    case distanceCycling = "distance_cycling"
    case distanceRunning = "distance_running"
    case caloriesBurnedTotal = "calories_burned_total"
    case caloriesBurnedBasal = "calories_burned_basal"
    case caloriesBurnedActive = "calories_burned_active"
}

public enum StatisticsInterval: String, Codable {
    case hour
    case day
}

public struct StatisticsFilter {
    public var excludeManual: Bool = false
    public var providers: [Provider]? = nil
}

// Result:

public struct Statistic: Codable, Hashable {
    public var start: Date
    public var end: Date
    public var duration: Int
    public var type: StatisticsType
    public var value: Double
    public var unit: Unit
    public var rowCount: Int?
    public var recordIds: [UUID]?
}
```

#### Records

```swift
func getRecords(
    ofTypes types: [MetricType.stepsTotal],
    from: Date.now.addingTimeInterval(-60 * 60 * 24),
    to: Date.now,
    filter: StatisticsFilter(providers: [.apple])
) async throws -> [Record]
```

where:

```swift
public enum MetricType: String, Codable, Hashable {
    case stepsTotal
    case distanceTotal
    case distanceWalking
    case distanceCycling
    case distanceRunning
    case caloriesBurnedActive
    case caloriesBurnedBasal
    case caloriesBurnedTotal
}

// Result

public struct Record: Codable, Hashable {
    public var recordId: UUID
    public var inputMethod: InputMethod?
    public var startAt: Date
    public var endAt: Date?
    public var modifiedAt: Date
    public var duration: Int?
    public var provider: Provider?
    public var providerSource: ProviderSource?
    public var isSourceAggregated: Bool?
    public var source: RecordSource?
    public var metrics: [String: Double]?
    public var activityTags: [ActivityTag]?
    public var activityType: ActivityType?
    public var sessions: [ActivityEntry]?
    public var laps: [ActivityEntry]?
    public var segments: [ActivityEntry]?
    public var splits: [ActivityEntry]?
    public var samples: [ActivitySamples]?
    public var routePoints: [ActivitySamples]?
}
```
