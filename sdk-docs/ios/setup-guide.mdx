```
pod 'SpikeSDK'
```

Use `pod install` and `pod update` commands to install/update pods afterward.

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate SpikeSDK into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager, add it in your `Package.swift` or through the Project's **Package Dependencies** tab:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://gitlab.com/spike_api/spike-ios-sdk", .upToNextMinor(from: "2.3.0"))
]
```
